        <p> Hi! I'm Annie Zhao, a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics. I'm interested in the intersection of these two fields, specifically when exploring
            how we utilize and manage data, ML/AI, and bioinformatics. </p>

        <p> I enjoy running, reading, and baking. </p>

        <p id="section-title">Why I took this course</p>
            <p> As someone interested in a career as a Software Engineer or a Data Engineer, a woman in tech, and a 
            Chinese-American, I believe it's important to continue to understand others' perspectives and experiences in the technology industry.
            </p>

            <p> I took this course as it offers a new perspective of my major and my future career. Understanding the challenges and opportunities that the people around me have encountered
            inspires me to become more inclusive in my personal, academic, and professional lives.</p>
