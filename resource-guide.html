        <p id="section-title"> Summary </p>

        <p> Implicit bias is the unconscious attitude, stereotypes, and prejudice we have towards other people that affect our actions and beliefs.</p>
            
        <p> An Implicit Bias Test (IBT) is a tool for revealing the unconscious biases we hold through measuring the associations we have between concepts and evalutations/stereotypes.</p>

        <p> Intersectionality is the awareness and undestanding of how we are shaped and consantly influenced by our own 
            identities and lived experiences. Utilizing intersectionality as a tool for analysis can help us better understand one another and the complexity
            of our lives and relationships. It is important to consider in the context of social inequality, and how they are truly impacted by a multitude of personal factors.</p>
